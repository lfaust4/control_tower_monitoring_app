The following is a set of instructions for launching the Control Tower R Shiny app. It consists of transforming the raw training and incoming data into a clean dataset for the app, as well as creating and saving plots for the app on the backend to speed up viewing them in the app.

1)	Change your R working directory to the downloaded “control_tower_demo” folder.
2)	Run “create_demo_features.R”
3)	Run “build_plots.R”
4)	Assuming you are using Rstudio, open “app.R” and click the “Run App” button.
